Where is the first occurrence of a multiple of $K$ in the sequence $7$, $77$, $777$, ...?

If the sequence contains no multiples of $K$, print `-1` instead.

## Input

A single input line contains a single integer $K$ ($1\leq{K}\leq{10^{6}}$).

## Output

Print a single integerâ€”the position of the first occurrence of a multiple of $K$.
